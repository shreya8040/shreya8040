## Hi there 👋 I'm Shreya


Discovering and learning more about my twin passions: Art and tech - both on their own plus all the interdisciplinary/children fields!

I wrote a review paper about them too : https://zenodo.org/records/17606681

My (very basic) portfolio: portfolio.withshreya.tech

I speak: 

Apart from art and tech, I love to read comics (ACKs and Tinkles) , play sports like badminton,basketball and cricket and... yeah pretty much anything alse I do is related to art or tech - sketch/paint/illustrate, craft stuff with paper cardboard and clay, tinker around on gadget settings, try to confuse and therefore test different LLMs, test different apps/websites or go down a rabbit hole researching about a vast topic like..computer networks or cybersecurity to learn something!

I like building small apps but at the same time, I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and make an impact
Open to collaborate : hello@withshreya.tech
