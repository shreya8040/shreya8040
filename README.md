## Hi there 👋 I'm Shreya


I'm on a forever quest of discovering and learning more about my twin passions: art and tech - both on their own plus all the interdisciplinary/children fields!  
        I wrote a review paper about them too : https://zenodo.org/records/17606681

My (very basic) portfolio: [portfolio.withshreya.tech](https://portfolio.withshreya.tech/)


Technically, I speak: <img width="24" height="24" alt="icons8-typescript-24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d0c3039-113c-4e95-9281-f8bd96b092d7" />  <img width="24" height="24" alt="icons8-javascript-48" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21c9ab88-ae26-4c8b-b63a-7491513ee22c" /> <img width="24" height="24" alt="icons8-react-js-24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcc5c9cc-4957-4c62-a0de-ba9a4ae6467c" /> <img width="24" height="24" alt="icons8-node-js-24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbf7b962-6567-4070-91f3-1383c5754bb4" /> <img width="24" height="24" alt="p5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8f942c2-88c5-4dac-8bdc-a647dff4ea6f" />   <img width="24" height="24" alt="electron" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ede7eb94-1503-4235-a958-d4b933288e7d" /> <img width="24" height="24" alt="icons8-python-24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/417041b0-316f-4229-87c1-54f5edc2c2de" /> <img width="24" height="24" alt="icons8-lua-24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b802843a-f3f7-4b0e-b1c6-e516ada4389a" /> <img width="24" height="24" alt="icons8-c++-24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc0a8b44-641b-4719-a674-c7dba32c4c88" /> <img width="24" height="24" alt="icons8-c-programming-24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5deeaea4-5dbc-455e-a855-bee76c99fe70" />

Apart from art and tech, I love to read comics (ACKs and Tinkles) , play sports like badminton,basketball and cricket and... yeah pretty much anything alse I do is related to art or tech - sketch/paint/illustrate, craft stuff with paper cardboard and clay, tinker around on gadget settings, try to confuse and therefore test different LLMs, test different apps/websites -I'm into consumer tech- or go down a rabbit hole trying to learn something by researching about a vast topic like...computer networks or cybersecurity!

I like building small apps but at the same time, I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and make an impact

Open to collaborate : hello@withshreya.tech
