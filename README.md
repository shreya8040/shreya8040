## Hi there 👋 I'm Shreya


Discovering and learning more about my twin passions: Art and tech - both on their own plus all the interdisciplinary/children fields!
I wrote a review paper about them too : https://zenodo.org/records/17606681
My (very basic) portfolio: portfolio.withshreya.tech

I speak: <img width="24" height="24" alt="javascript" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bb8180b-33d0-4850-8ac7-c30ba6c1f29d" /> <img width="24" height="24" alt="typescript" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/097827cb-876b-496c-a339-0c021d4307f6" /> <img width="24" height="24" alt="python" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dff3d383-816f-4336-a32d-dae6f1b858a2" /> <img width="24" height="24" alt="lua" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76c6fc02-e1c2-41b6-b390-ab1bc3c16f7b" />


Apart from art and tech, I love to read comics (ACKs and Tinkles) , play sports like badminton,basketball and cricket and... yeah pretty much anything alse I do is related to art or tech - sketch/paint/illustrate, craft stuff with paper cardboard and clay, tinker around on gadget settings, try to confuse and therefore test different LLMs, test different apps/websites or go down a rabbit hole researching about a vast topic like..computer networks or cybersecurity to learn something!

I like building small apps but at the same time, I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and make an impact
Open to collaborate : hello@withshreya.tech
