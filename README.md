## Hi there 👋 I'm Shreya



Discovering and learning more about my twin passions: Art and tech - both on their own plus all the interdisciplinary/children fields!

I wrote a review paper about them too : https://zenodo.org/records/17606681

My (very basic) portfolio: portfolio.withshreya.tech

I like building small apps but at the same time, I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and make an impact!
